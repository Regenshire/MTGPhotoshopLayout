# ProxySheet ‚Äì Photoshop Proxy Layout Tool

> **Layout. Print. Proxy. All in Photoshop.**

ProxySheet is a powerful desktop application and Photoshop scripting engine for laying out and printing high-quality Magic: The Gathering proxy cards. It provides a graphical UI for building layouts, managing configurations, exporting PDFs, and preparing cut-ready Silhouette Studio files.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 or macOS 12+
- **Photoshop**: Adobe Photoshop 2021 or later (tested with 2023+)
- **Setup Notes**:
  - Photoshop scripting must be enabled
  - Extract the full release zip and keep the files together

---

## Getting Started

1. **Download and Run ProxySheet**

   - **Windows Users (Recommended)**:\
     Download the latest release `.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Regenshire/MTGPhotoshopLayout/releases) page.\
     Extract it and double-click:

     ```
     ProxySheet.exe
     ```

   - **macOS / Advanced Users**:\
     Clone the repository and run with Node.js:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Regenshire/MTGPhotoshopLayout.git
     cd MTGPhotoshopLayout
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

2. **Make Sure Photoshop is Installed and Configured**

   - Requires **Adobe Photoshop 2021 or later**
   - Photoshop scripting must be enabled (default is enabled)

3. **Begin Using ProxySheet**

   - Use the **Create** tab to build new layouts
   - Use **Configs** to run and manage saved settings
   - Press **Run Now** to generate and launch the script in Photoshop

## üß≠ Key Functional Tabs

- **Create**: Design custom layout configurations with full control over page size, layout style, card format, cut marks, color adjustments, and back alignment.
- **Configs**: Browse saved scripts by folder, search, sort, and rerun or edit existing setups.
- **History**: Re-run exact config batches with saved image paths and settings. [BETA FEATURE - Does not work for PDF Batches]
- **Silhouette**: Launch `.studio` or `.studio3` cutting templates. Edit and tag metadata for searchability. Only have Letter and A4 templates currently built. Have 8 card and 7 card layouts. The 7 card layout reduces detection errors and improves cut reliability.
- **Tools**: Convert images (format, DPI, bleed), apply color adjustments, and prepare proxy-ready assets.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Features

- **Layout**: Horizontal (2x4), Vertical (3x3), SevenCard
- **Paper Size**: Letter, A4, A3, Legal, Tabloid, or Custom
- **Card Format**:
  - MPC (with bleed)
  - NoBleed (Scryfall-style trimmed cards)
  - Custom card sizes by specifying width and height
- **Silhouette Cameo Registration**: Detection registration marks for Silhouette Cameo cutting machine
- **Crop Settings**:
  - Toggle crop marks
  - Customize cut size and offset (mm)
- **Color Adjustments**:
  - Brightness, Contrast, Vibrance, Saturation, Gamma, Whitepoint, Blackpoint can all be controlled in the scripts
  - Cards also receive their own individual Color Adjustment layers for individual adjustment within Photoshop.  This feature is excluded for PDF Batch Exports and Image conversions, but is available for single page configs.
- **Back Alignment**:
  - Card Back Offset Support
  - Ability to Prompt for each Card Back
- **PDF Batch Export**:
  - Multipage Batch Export support
  - Supports Card backs for both standard and double-sided cards
  - Double-sided cards are automated by matching the filename of the card with the back cards specified using a [Back] or {Back} tag in the filename.  For example: If you have "The Kami War {227}.jpg" and "The Kami War {227} [Back].jpg" in the same folder, it will detect this as a double-sided card with the Back being the file with [Back] in the name.
  - Allows you to select a back for all non-double-sided cards
  - Supports excluding Back images by selecting the No Back Images option
  - Supports combined or seperate files for fronts and backs
- **Notes & Metadata**:
  - Add printed notes to sheet
  - Embed batch number visually in card lower right corner

## üìù PDF Batch Export

ProxySheet includes a powerful **Batch Export system** designed for high-volume printing of proxies. Instead of building a single layout manually, you can automatically split dozens or hundreds of card images into multiple pages ‚Äî and generate print-ready PDFs in one pass.  Adobe Photoshop does not natively support multi-page workflows.  This batch system creates each page in Adobe Photoshop (allowing for adjustment layers) and then outputs them as individual PDF files.  It then merges those files together into a single document.

The PDF Batch Export system supports double-sided cards.  It identifies these cards when it searches the folder and detects two cards with the same name, but one with a [Back] or {Back} tag in the filename.  For example, if you have "The Kami War {227}.jpg" and "The Kami War {227} [Back].jpg" in the same folder, it will detect this as a double-sided card with the back of the card being the file with [Back] in the name.  The Batch system seperates Double-Sided cards into their own sheets for printing convenience.

### üöÄ How It Works

1. **Enable Batch Export**

   - On the **Create** tab, check `Multipage Batch Export`

2. **Select Card Folder**

   - You'll be prompted to choose a folder of card images.
   - ProxySheet automatically groups them into sheets based on your selected layout and paper size.

3. **Back Side Options**

   - Choose whether to use a **single back image** or **per-card backs**.
   - You can also enable `No Back Images` if printing fronts only.

4. **Run Batch**

   - ProxySheet creates `.jsx` scripts for each sheet (front and optional back)
   - These are executed in Photoshop automatically
   - Progress is tracked in real-time via a **Processing Overlay** with sentinel status

5. **PDF Merging**

   - Once Photoshop has generated all the pages, ProxySheet merges them into one or more PDFs:
     - üìú `ProxySheet_Batch_001_Combined.pdf` ‚Äî interleaved front/back
     - üìú `ProxySheet_Batch_001_Front.pdf` and `_Back.pdf` ‚Äî if separate export is enabled

6. **Output Location**

   - Final PDFs are saved to the `/PDFOutput/` folder
   - Temporary files are cleaned automatically

### ‚öôÔ∏è Export Configuration Options

| Option                             | Description                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Multipage Batch Export`           | Enables batch splitting                       |
| `No Back Images`                   | Skips back side entirely                      |
| `Separate PDFs for Front and Back` | Produces two files instead of one interleaved |
| `Enable Silhouette Registration`   | Adds support for Silhouette cutting machines  |
| `Show Crop/Cut Marks`              | Adds corner alignment markers for trimming    |
| `Offset X/Y (Back)`                | Adjusts back alignment for duplex printers    |

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- Fully automated page splitting for **hundreds of proxies**
- Optimized layouts based on card format, paper size, and layout style
- Accurate **front-to-back alignment** for duplex printing
- Optional cut marks and white notes for manual trimming
- Output is fully **print-shop ready**

### üìå Results

Here is an example of a traditional 9 card Letter batch with both front and back.

Here is an example of a 7 card letter layout for Silhouette with the selected card back.  The seven card layout reduces cutting errors by giving space around the left most registration marks.

Here is an example of a 7 card letter layout for Silhouette for douhle sided cards. Both of these sets of sheets came from the same batch.  The batch seperated the double-sided cards into their own segment of pages.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Silhouette Studio Support

- Launch `.studio3` files from the **Silhouette** tab
- Edit and sort templates with metadata (Title, Description, Tags, Order)
- Ready-to-cut files for SevenCard and normal eight card layouts, supports both MPC and No Bleed cards.  Additional templates will be added in the future.
- Requires the Silhouette Studio software to use

- DPI rescaling
- Format conversion (JPG, PNG)
- Optional black bleed padding (for NoBleed prep)
- Color correction adjustments (brightness, contrast, etc.)
