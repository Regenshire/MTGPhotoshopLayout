# MTGPhotoshopLayout
Regen Photoshop Print Layout

## How to install
1. Extract the *.jsx* script file and the *01-CutMarkOverlay.png* file to the same directory.  If the Cut Line overlay is missing, the script will display an error and not show the cut guides.  This file can be edited if you want custom cut lines.

## How to use Script
1. Run the .*jsx* script in Photoshop by either double-clicking the script or going to File > Scripts > Browse and selecting the script
2. A file select window will appear.  In this window, select up to 9 cards and press OK.  It will layout the cards alphabetically and apply the Brightness, Contrast, Vibrance, Saturation, and other settings specified in the script file automatically as well as add cut marks to the output.  Individual Brightness/Contrast and Vibrance Layers will also be added to every card, allowing the user to tweak on a per card basis within Photoshop if they choose without manually adding layers.
3. The user can print directly from Photoshop, or they can export to any file format they choose such as PDF.

## How to Customize Script Defaults
The script can be edited.  At the top of the script file are variables that control the page layout, card size, dpi, and the brightness/contract, vibrance, saturation, gmm, whitepoint, and blackpoint layers the script uses.
